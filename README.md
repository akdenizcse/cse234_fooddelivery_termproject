Project requirements are as follows:
 Projects must be developed with Kotlin programming language on Android Studio. 
-> We use kotlin compose 
 Each project must have Sign-up and Sign-in features.
-> We added sign-in and sign-up pages for both the restaurant and customer sides.
 Main Layout should have tabs. 
-> We added a bottom bar for navigating the screen.
 Each project must have a main screen and other necessary screens. (Page navigation is necessary)
-> We added Navigation for navigate other screen
 You can use cloud hosted databases such as Google’s firebase
-> We used Firebase for authentication, storing products, storing restaurant information, and storing orders.
 Each project must use a backend service (APIs) in order to post/receive messages. You can search 
for open-source APIs for your use. 
->We retrieved the provinces and districts for the address page from the API.
 If your app needs a purchasing feature, you don’t need to do actual purchases. Simulation is 
enough. 
-> We added a purchasing simulation feature using Firebase.
